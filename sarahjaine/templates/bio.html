				<p>Iâ€™m a full-stack web developer living in Washington DC. In my free time, I teach beginner friendly Python classes through <a href="http://hearmecode.com/" target="_blank">Hear Me Code</a>. I am actively seeking a full-time permanent position as a web developer. I'm also available for hire for short term projects.</p>
				<p>I am passionate about making the world a happier and more productive place through web development and software innovation. Specifically, I want to harness the power of the internet to help vulnerable populations access resources. I think the internet is the ideal tool for sharing ideas and experiences, and lifting each other up.</p>
				<p>As someone who is the happiest when teaching and learning, I like to be part of communities that value continuous development and improvement. In the next year, I want to create an iOS app, learn more about web security and hacking, and finish another maker project.</p>
