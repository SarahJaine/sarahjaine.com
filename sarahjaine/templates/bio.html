				<p>Iâ€™m a full-stack developer living and working in Washington DC. In my free time, I teach beginner friendly Python classes through Hear Me Code.  I am actively seeking a full-time permanent position as a web developer.</p>
				<p>I am passionate about making the world a happier and more productive place through web development and software innovation.  Specifically, I want to harness the power of the internet to help vulnerable populations access needed resources.  I think the internet is the ideal tool for sharing ideas and experiences, and lifting each other up.</p>
				<p>I am also passionate about learning and continuous personal improvement.  I am the happiest when I am teaching and learning.  In the next year I want to create an iOS app, learn more about web security and hacking, and finish another maker project.</p>
